# Python pandas mongo simple example

This code is an example on how to calculate the size of an specific database table or schema and then, use that data to feed pandas' dataframes and try to graph those results.

MongoDB is used. You must define in your environment, the system variables that you need in terms of Database name, credentials and such.

## Installation

You need to install pymongo, pyodbc, pandas and matplotlib.

Also, you need to configure the FreeTDS driver in order for this code to work. Here is a useful link on how to do that: https://gist.github.com/Bouke/10454272
