# Python POST requests POC

This code is an example on how to valdiate an API endpoint using POST requests with the pytest platform.

## Installation
I recomed using a virutal env, which you can set up using:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

You can also add system variables to the venv/bin/activate to make sure they are available for your tests.

You can use pip3 to install the needed packages:
```bash
pip3 -m install <pacakage_name> 
```
